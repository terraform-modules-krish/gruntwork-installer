# fix aarch64 fetch install

**harrymilne** commented *Nov 13, 2021*

## Problem

* `uname -m` returns `aarch64` on EKS ARM AMIs which causes `get_os_arch_gox_format` to return `amd64` rather than `arm64`
* fetch `0.4.1` has no ARM build

## Solution

* add case for `aarch64` returning `arm64`
* bump fetch version

Tested on x86 + ARM builds
