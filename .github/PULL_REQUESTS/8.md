@brikis98 Seems like a no-brainer, but let me know if any concerns before I merge.

I'm running into some strange behavior on a Circle build, mainly that each time I run it a different command fails. I highly doubt this has anything to do with fetch, but just to eliminate the possibility, I'll merge this now.

I suspect I was hitting intermittent network failures. I since fixed the issue.
