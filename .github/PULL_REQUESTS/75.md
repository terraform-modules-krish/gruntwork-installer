## Description

The header of the bootstrap script uses an older tag as an example:

```
$ curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-installer/master/bootstrap-gruntwork-installer.sh | bash /dev/stdin --version 0.0.3

Installing gruntwork-install version 0.0.3 to /usr/local/bin/gruntwork-install
```

What we want to see is:
```
$ curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-installer/master/bootstrap-gruntwork-installer.sh | bash /dev/stdin --version v0.0.38
Installing gruntwork-install version v0.0.38 to /usr/local/bin/gruntwork-install
```
