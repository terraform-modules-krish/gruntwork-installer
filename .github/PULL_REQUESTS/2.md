# Add basic automated tests

**brikis98** commented *May 9, 2016*

This PR adds a very basic level of automated tests to the Gruntwork installer. It runs a bare-minimum-end-to-end integration test: run the bootstrap script to install `gruntwork-install` and then run `gruntwork-install` to install a module from script-modules. 

The tests run in a Docker container to keep your local environment clean.

Great to see automated tests here. Feel free to merge once you've responded to my comments.
