# Preserve whitespace in parameter values and treat as whole args

**jeckhart** commented *May 2, 2020*

The installer supports passing parameters to the module installers. However, in several places it's munging the whitespace and splitting the arguments into multiple args.

This change seeks to maintain args as single, whole args and not split on whitespace.

MacOS doesn't have `mapfile` (or `readarray`) because it's still using Bash 3.2 . ðŸ¤• 

I looked at the other options I tested, and this is the best I could find that works in most scenarios and preserves whitespace. It does go back and need `eval` though.

I'll split out the test case into a separate PR so that it can be merged ahead of time.

OK, just merged your other two PRs and released https://github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-installer/releases/tag/v0.0.25. Could you rebase on `master` and update your test code to point to `v0.0.25` so I can run the tests?
