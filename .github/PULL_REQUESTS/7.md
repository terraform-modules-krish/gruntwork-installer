# Add packer-file-copy script module and rewrite main README.

**josh-padnick** commented *Sep 1, 2016*

This PR:
1. Adds the `packer-file-copy` Script Module to this repo.
2. Rewrites the top-level README to reflect our now more clear understanding of the role of Gruntwork Script Modules.

I'd also like to propose using the term "Gruntwork Script Module" as a first-class term. At some point, we may further clarify that in addition to "Script Modules" we have other types of modules. For example, the module used to generate a TLS cert for Vault isn't a Script Module, but maybe an "Execution Module".

@brikis98 For now, let me know your thoughts on what's updated in this PR.

Overall, LGTM. I just made some nitpicky comments about the README updates. Respond to those and merge away.
