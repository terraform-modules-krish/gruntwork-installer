# Allow public repo access

**yorinasub17** commented *May 7, 2019*

Right now `gruntwork-install` enforces the condition that `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN` is set, but this does not need to be set for public repos (e.g `terragrunt`, `terratest`, and soon `kubergrunt`). This PR adds a simple check to see if the repo can be accessed anonymously (does not 404), and if so, ignore the check.

LGTM! 

As a separate thought, it's out of scope for this PR but the one other change I've been wanting to make for a while is adding support for the env var `GITHUB_TOKEN` in addition to `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN` to preserve backwards compatibility but make the env var easier to set.

Merging! Thanks for the review!
