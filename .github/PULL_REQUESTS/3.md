# Allow specifying a custom repo for gruntwork-install

This PR allows us to install modules from repos other than script-modules. Since the plan is to break up terraform-modules and script-modules into many separate repos, this becomes important.

@josh-padnick I'm going to merge this so I can keep making progress on the ECS work. Please leave comments when you have a chance.
