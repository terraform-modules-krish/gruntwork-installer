# Support a no-sudo install (limited to binaries)

**yorinasub17** commented *May 7, 2020*

This PR addresses https://github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-installer/issues/48

Specifically, both the bootstrap script and `gruntwork-install` now support an argument `--no-sudo` to allow installing binaries without the use of `sudo`.
