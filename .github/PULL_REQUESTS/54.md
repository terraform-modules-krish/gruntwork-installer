# First pass at enabling HTTP retries across the installer scripts.

**niallrmurphy** commented *Nov 19, 2020*

This PR does the initial plumbing in bash for enabling download retries in the installer scripts.

The general philosophy is to rely on the native capabilities of curl (and whatever other tools we use) to do this, rather than (re)implementing it in bash. Notably, this means implementing similar retry logic in fetch, which is a separate PR.
