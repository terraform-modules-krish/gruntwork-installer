## Description

Addresses part of https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-chasers/issues/32

We've updated the default branch of this repo to `main`. However we still have a copy of the old default branch that we are allowing to get stale. No updates after this PR should be merged into it. We will delete that branch on February 1, 2023.

Note: This PR will be merged onto the old default branch, not `main`.

When someone uses the old default branch, they'll see this notice:

## Release Notes (draft)

Added a deprecation notice warning users to specify a tagged release. We've updated the default branch to `main`. **NOTE**: We will delete the old default branch, `master`, on February 1, 2023, to allow a (hopefully generous) transition time.
