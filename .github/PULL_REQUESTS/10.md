# Add --download-dir option.

While building an AMI on top of a hardened OS that prevented any files from being executed from `/tmp`, I hit an error where the Gruntwork Installer only downloads to `/tmp` with no other options. This enables the option to specify a custom directory from which a file can be downloaded to and installed from.

Tests are passing. @brikis98 is on vacation, so merging now.
