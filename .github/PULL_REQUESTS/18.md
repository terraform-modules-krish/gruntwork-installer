# Fix issue with quotes around module params.

**josh-padnick** commented *Nov 14, 2017*

Previously, values passed to `--module-param` (e.g. `--module-param "version=3.4.1"`) were rendering to with single quotes (e.g. `'3.4.1'`), whereas the single quotes should have been omitted (i.e. `3.4.1`). This issue was causing some `install.sh` scripts that were receiving these module param values to fail. 

This PR fixes the issue.

Feedback welcome as usual. Merging now.

Not sure I follow what problem the single quotes were causing? Which install scripts were failing?

This is the type of error I was getting when passing in a `--module-param`:

```

That's most likely because you were on v0.0.16. In the very next version, I fixed the params by using `eval`: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-installer/releases/tag/v0.0.17. I suspect switching to double quotes as you did here had no effect; it was the upgrade past v0.0.16 that actually fixed it.

You and Matt may want to dig into the PRs I put up, even after they have been merged. It's important for all of us to keep up with these changes.

Hmm, we're duplicating each other's efforts on many fronts, it seems :/ Actually, I tested this code by copying the latest version in git to a Docker container and then running it there to repro the issue. It explicitly failed pre-double-quotes, and adding the double quotes explicitly fixed it.

Your general point on catching up on earlier PRs is well-taken, but for now, it seems like we're good here.
