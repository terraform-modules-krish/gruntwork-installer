# Fix how module-param args are handled

**brikis98** commented *Aug 15, 2017*

This PR fixes a bug with the `--module-param` args of `gruntwork-install`. We wrap those args in single quotes to handle possible spaces, but in order for that to work correctly, we need to `eval` the args. 

Along the way, I had to do a bit of yak shaving to fix other issues in the tests. Not sure how these passed before?
