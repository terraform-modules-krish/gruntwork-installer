# Update fetch to support checksum validation on binary assets.

**josh-padnick** commented *Mar 1, 2018*

- Update gruntwork-install to use fetch v0.2.0
- Update gruntwork-install to accept params `--binary-sha256-checksum` and  `--binary-sha512-checksum` which can be used to validate a binary release.

Ah, one thing we forgot: update the [security section in the Readme](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-installer#security) to talk about checksums.
