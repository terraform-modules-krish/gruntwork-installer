# Update fetch to version with a proper logger

**robmorgan** commented *Feb 5, 2021*

This PR updates `fetch` to use the proper logger that was added in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch/pull/90 and released in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch/releases/tag/v0.4.0. I've also bumped the version v0.4.1 to include a minor fix for the usage help text.
