# bootstrap: allow user to override BIN_DIR & USER_DATA_DIR

**thinkmassive** commented *Apr 26, 2023*

## Description

- Fixes #87
- Probably fixes #17

This tiny enhancement allows a user to specify alternate locations for the binaries and user-data. Overriding these values to a location where the user has write privileges will allow this script to run without root permissions.

It is probably an uncommon use case, and an advanced user should quickly notice these optional overrides when reviewing the script since they're at the very beginning. For this reason, I did not add a CLI parameter nor documentation.

## TODOs
