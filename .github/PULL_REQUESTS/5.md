# Add support for installing binaries

**brikis98** commented *Jun 20, 2016*

This PR allows `gruntwork-install` to install not only source folders under a `modules` directory in GitHub, but also binaries assets uploaded to a GitHub release.

This also removes the script-modules repo as the default, since we are actively moving everything out of it and actually prefer that it's not used anymore. Since `gruntwork-install` is versioned, this shouldn't affect any existing users.

@josh-padnick Since you're out today, I'm going to merge this to unblock myself. Please review when you get a chance.
