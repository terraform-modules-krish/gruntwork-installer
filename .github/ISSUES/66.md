# Cannot install on a VM

**rhoboat** commented *Jul 9, 2021*

A user provided this error log to illustrate that they couldn't use the installer to install openvpn-admin on a VM.

```
gruntwork-install --binary-name openvpn-admin --repo https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-openvpn --tag v0.5.4
```

Error:
```
2021-07-02 12:08:08 [INFO] [gruntwork-install] Installing openvpn-admin...

2021-07-02 12:08:09 [INFO] [gruntwork-install] Moving /tmp/gruntwork-script-modules/openvpn-admin_linux_amd64 to /usr/local/bin/openvpn-admin and setting execute permissions

mv: cannot stat '/tmp/gruntwork-script-modules/openvpn-admin_linux_amd64': No such file or directory
```

We suspect that this has to do with the downloaded file being in the wrong place (i.e., the native system instead of the VM), or something like that. Is this a case we should support?

Workaround: Allow the script to complete and error out. Manually `scp` or otherwise locate the file and move it to the right place, adding execute permissions.

The script defaults the download dir to `/tmp/gruntwork-script-modules`. Perhaps there is no `/tmp` on this VM? Or the user doesn't have permissions to write to `/tmp`? In either case, I suspect there may have been an error earlier in the log output. Could we see the full logs?

If this indeed the error, the workaround is to override the download dir with the `--download-dir` param to something writeable. The full fix is likely to also use a function like `mktemp` to create a temp dir in the right place, rather than assume `/tmp`.

This might be true, but I think it's a smell for `gruntwork-install` to make it this far (moving the file) when there was an error in the download step. It should be exiting out earlier in the process if there was an earlier error. We should definitely comb through the script to make sure it fails fast.

Yes, agreed!

I ran into this in a related use case.  `fetch` is not failing under some conditions.  I think this is happening at https://github.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-installer/blob/main/gruntwork-install#L167

This should fail.  You don't have this release in your repo:
```
$ fetch --log-level debug --repo=https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-security --tag=support_non_commercial_partitions --release-asset=ssh-grunt.\* /tmp/gruntwork-script-modules
$ echo $?
0
```

But I do...
```
$ fetch --log-level debug --repo=https://github.com/octo-radiance-iac/terraform-aws-security --tag=support_non_commercial_partitions --release-asset='.*' /tmp/gruntwork-script-modules
[fetch] INFO[2022-08-24T12:36:34-04:00] Downloading release asset ssh-grunt_linux_amd64 to /tmp/gruntwork-script-modules/ssh-grunt_linux_amd64
[fetch] INFO[2022-08-24T12:36:34-04:00] Downloaded /tmp/gruntwork-script-modules/ssh-grunt_linux_amd64
[fetch] INFO[2022-08-24T12:36:34-04:00] Download of release assets complete
$ echo $?
0
```

`fetch` should fail in the first case, which would prevent `gruntwork-install` from continuing on to say it will move a file that was not successfully downloaded.
