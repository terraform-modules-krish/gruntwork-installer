# Add optional retry

**autero1** commented *May 29, 2019*

Every now and then GitHub API fails with GitHub API error `Failed to download file at the url https://api.github.com/repos/xxx/xxx/zipball/xxx. Received HTTP Response 502.`. To make the installer more resilient to those transient errors, an optional retry should be added.

Because `gruntwork-installer` uses [fetch](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/fetch), one option could be adding the retry to `fetch` instead.
