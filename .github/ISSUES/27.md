This is legacy code that never got used.

That said, we should standardize on a common install location for all Gruntwork utilities. Perhaps `/opt/gruntwork/<repo>/<module>`?

I would actually make the path even more explicit:

`/opt/gruntwork-utilities/<repo>/<module>`.

This way, customers won't think there's some kind of tool called "gruntwork" running on their server.
