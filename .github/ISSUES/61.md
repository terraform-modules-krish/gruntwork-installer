# Problem with build packer image

**es1o** commented *Mar 15, 2021*

Hello.

I have a problem with running command:
```
    "type": "shell",
    "inline": [
      "curl -LsS  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gruntwork-io/gruntwork-installer/master/bootstrap-gruntwork-installer.sh | bash /dev/stdin --version v0.0.35"
    ]},
```

Looks like it stucks, I see no output from curl, packer try run next commands and from next shell provisioner but fails because command `gruntwork-install` is not available.

It may be closed, it is releated to wrong example from documetation, and I'll update documentation upstream.
