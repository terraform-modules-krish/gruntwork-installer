# Running gruntwork-install requires github oauth and does not allow ssh authentication.

It seems like using ssh auth for git is much more scalable for teams, as you don't have to set an oauth token anywhere.

Ah, I see that oauth is used for API calls whereas ssh keys only work with the git command line client, which makes sense.
