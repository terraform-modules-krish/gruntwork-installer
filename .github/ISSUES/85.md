# Gruntwork Installer Installing Vulnerable Fetch Package

**trsreagan3** commented *Apr 11, 2023*


Gruntwork installer needs to install an updated version of fetch. It is also possible that fetch will need to be patched after gruntwork install is installing the updated version. I am not sure if the most recent fetch release is patched.

Fetch details:
- CVE-2022-27664

Installed version: 1.16.2
Patched version: 1.18.6
Paths: /usr/local/bin/fetch
