# Fix local / readonly usage

**brikis98** commented *May 3, 2020*

The Gruntwork Installer is still using our old, incorrect bash pattern of declaring variables:

```bash
local readonly foo="bar"
```

Combining `local` and `readonly` this way doesn't actually work. We need to change to:

```bash
local -r foo="bar"
```

Or, in the case of arrays:

```bash
local -ar foo=("aaa" "bbb")
```
